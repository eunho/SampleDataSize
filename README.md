#### Note:																										
Avoid PEEKING to stopping the test as soon as the results "look" significant																										
Significance level(Type I error): Probability of the difference between control and challenger will be detected, when actually it does NOT exist. 																										
Statistical power(1-Type II error): Probability of the difference between control and challenger will be detected, when actually it exists.
